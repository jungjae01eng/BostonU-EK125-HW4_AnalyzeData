# BostonU-EK125-Homework 4
## Analyze Data Sets

### Goals & Hypothesis
- Our goal from this assignment is to find out whether or not a higher class average has a positive correlation with a student's overall course grade. 
  - We hypothesize that this correlation is in fact true, as going to more classes and getting good scores on participation and other elements usually means that one is better prepared for exams and projects. 

- Our second goal is to find which time period of the day is most conducive to learning EK125. 
  - We hypothesize that morning lectures, such as a 9:00 AM class, will lead to higher overall class and course grades due to the freshness of the students' minds.

### Conclusion
- The conclusions that we were able to make were that average class (lecture) grade has no effect on the overall course grade of an individual students,
  and that time of lecture has almost no effect on an individuals course grade.
  - The first inference can be seen through the correlation coefficient of these data vectors, as the correlation coefficient is around 0.6008.
  This is low enough to see that there is very little correlation.
  - The second inference can be seen by the fact that all 4 time slows for lectures had an average course grade tha differed by less than a single full point.
